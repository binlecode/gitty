= gitty

Web front-end for hosting Git repositories.

This is a reduced-functionality clone of Github. But have access to the source
code, so you can add that feature that you always wished GitHub would have! You
can also install it behind your firewall for free.

== Installation

Gitty needs a dedicated user for git+ssh. To create the user, run the following
command, replacing web_user with the name of the user that the Rails server runs
under.  
    script/git_user/setup git web_user

Conventionally, the dedicated user's name is "git". It can be changed by
replacing the first argument in the command above, then changing the
configuration variable git_user by going to
    http://gitty_server/_/config_vars

You should probably visit the configuration variables page anyway, to change the
admin password.
    http://gitty_server/_/config_vars
