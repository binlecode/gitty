= gitty

Web front-end for hosting Git repositories.

This is a reduced-functionality clone of Github. On the bright side, you can
install it on your intranet, and get free private repositories.

== Installation

Gitty needs a dedicated user for git+ssh. To create the user, run the following
command, replacing web_user with the name of the user that the Rails server runs
under.  
    script/git_user/setup git web_user

Conventionally, the dedicated user's name is "git". It can be changed by
replacing the first argument in the command above, then changing the
configuration variable git_user by going to
    http://gitty_server/_/config_vars

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
